#Using the following variables:

good_driving_record = true
age = 26

#Write a program that evaluates the status of the variables above, and uses logic to print one of three possible messages:
#- If the driving record is good and user is over 25 years old, they should get a discount on the car rental
#- If the user either has a good record or is over 25 years old, they should pay full price
#- If the user is not over 25 and has a bad driving record, they need to have someone else sign for the rental

if good_driving_record = true && age > 25
    puts "nice, broseph, enjoy a slick discount on your rental of this tricked out toyota corolla"
elsif good_driving_record = true || age > 25
    puts "My boss is coming down on me and I can't keep giving out discounts, you gotta pay full price"
else   
    puts "so do you have like a parent that can sign this for you?"
